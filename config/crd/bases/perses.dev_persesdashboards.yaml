                          "A Time represents an instant in time with nanosecond
                          precision. \n Programs using times should typically store and
                          pass them as values, not pointers. That is, time variables and
                          struct fields should be of type time.Time, not *time.Time. \n
                          A Time value can be used by multiple goroutines simultaneously
                          except that the methods GobDecode, UnmarshalBinary, UnmarshalJSON
                          and UnmarshalText are not concurrency-safe. \n Time instants
                          can be compared using the Before, After, and Equal methods.
                          The Sub method subtracts two instants, producing a Duration.
                          The Add method adds a Time and a Duration, producing a Time.
                          \n The zero value of type Time is January 1, year 1, 00:00:00.000000000
                          UTC. As this time is unlikely to come up in practice, the IsZero
                          method gives a simple way of detecting a time that has not been
                          initialized explicitly. \n Each Time has associated with it
                          a Location, consulted when computing the presentation form of
                          the time, such as in the Format, Hour, and Year methods. The
                          methods Local, UTC, and In return a Time with a specific location.
                          Changing the location in this way changes only the presentation;
                          it does not change the instant in time being denoted and therefore
                          does not affect the computations described in earlier paragraphs.
                          \n Representations of a Time value saved by the GobEncode, MarshalBinary,
                          MarshalJSON, and MarshalText methods store the Time.Location's
                          offset, but not the location name. They therefore lose information
                          about Daylight Saving Time. \n In addition to the required “wall
                          clock” reading, a Time may contain an optional reading of the
                          current process's monotonic clock, to provide additional precision
                          for comparison or subtraction. See the “Monotonic Clocks” section
                          in the package documentation for details. \n Note that the Go
                          == operator compares not just the time instant but also the
                          Location and the monotonic clock reading. Therefore, Time values
                          should not be used as map or database keys without first guaranteeing
                          that the identical Location has been set for all values, which
                          can be achieved through use of the UTC or Local method, and
                          that the monotonic clock reading has been stripped by setting
                          t = t.Round(0). In general, prefer t.Equal(u) to t == u, since
                          t.Equal uses the most accurate comparison available and correctly
                          handles the case when only one of its arguments has a monotonic
                          clock reading."
